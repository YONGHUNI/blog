# About Me

I’m currently a research intern at the [**Data Science for Humanity Group**](https://www.mpi-sp.org/cha){target="_blank"} at **the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy**, where I apply machine learning and remote sensing to better understand and address the challenges facing our society and environment.

I am interested in leveraging high performance computing within the domain of Geography, GIScience, machine learning, and remote sensing. My thesis of master degree involves real-time monitoring of landslide susceptibility using high-resolution active remote sensing data.

I earned my Master’s degree in Geography from Seoul National University, advised by [Dr. Gunhak Lee](https://geog.snu.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?tbl=bbs13&mode=VIEW&num=11&category=&findType=&findWord=&sort1=&sort2=&it_id=&shop_flag=&mobile_flag=&language=EN&page=1){target="_blank"}. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies at Kongju National University, earning a B.A. in Geography and a B.Sc. in Atmospheric Science. Throughout my academic journey, I've published several research papers and presented at various conferences, exploring topics like landslide prediction, population density estimation, and the impact of air pollution on active transportation.

In addition to my research, I'm involved in a community-based air quality project at the State University of New York at Buffalo([UB Clean Air](https://ubairqualitystudy.github.io/EPA-Website/index.html){target="_blank"}). I'm skilled in programming with R, Python, and Julia, and I have extensive experience with GIS and remote sensing software.

<div>

-   [This project](https://ubairqualitystudy.github.io/EPA-Website/index.html){target="_blank"} deployed 30 low-cost air sensors across East Buffalo to capture local PM2.5 data, revealing pollution patterns overlooked by official monitors.

-   A community-designed dashboard improved real-time access to air quality data, supporting environmental awareness and public health equity.

-   The findings were presented at the *Joint Annual Meeting of the International Society of Exposure Science and the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology 2025 (ISES-ISEE 2025)*.

</div>

<div>

-   This study presents a machine learning model to predict landslide susceptibility using Interferometric SAR displacement data and Hybrid Surface Rainfall estimates, emphasizing the role of active remote sensing.

-   The findings highlight the potential of using remote sensing data for landslide susceptibility assessment, offering valuable insights for disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies.

## Delayed effects of air pollution on public bike-sharing system use in Seoul, South Korea: A time series analysis

\

::::: grid
<div>

![](data/publication_figure/PBS.PNG)

</div>

<div>

-   This study examines the short-term impact of ambient air pollution on public bike-sharing system (PBS) usage in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, finding a consistent negative association between elevated levels of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3) and bike usage the following day.

-   The analysis reveals that high pollution days are linked to a reduction in cycling behavior, with no variations based on age, COVID-19, or seasonality.
