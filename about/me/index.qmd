# About Me

I am a system administrator of two GPU clusters in the Office of Information & Computing Center, at College of Engineering, Seoul National University (SNU). I finished my master's in Geography at SNU in Feb. 2024, advised by Dr. Gunhak Lee.

I am interested in leveraging high performance computing within the domain of Geography, GIScience, machine learning, and remote sensing. My thesis of master degree involves real-time monitoring of landslide susceptibility using high-resolution active remote sensing data.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Kongju National University, earning a B.A. in Geography and a B.Sc. in Atmospheric Science. Throughout my academic journey, I've published several research papers and presented at various conferences, exploring topics like landslide prediction, population density estimation, and the impact of air pollution.

In addition to my research, I'm involved in a community-based air quality project at the State University of New York at Buffalo([UB Clean Air](https://ubairqualitystudy.github.io/EPA-Website/index.html)) and manage GPU clusters for the College of Engineering at SNU. I'm skilled in programming with R, Python, and Julia, and I have extensive experience with GIS and remote sensing software.

## Delayed effects of air pollution on public bike-sharing system use in Seoul, South Korea: A time series analysis

<div>
    
* This study examines the short-term impact of ambient air pollution on public bike-sharing system (PBS) usage in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, finding a consistent negative association between elevated levels of air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3) and bike usage the following day.

* The analysis reveals that high pollution days are linked to a reduction in cycling behavior, with no variations based on age, COVID-19, or seasonality.

<div>


![](/data/about/publication_figure/dasymetric.PNG)


</div>

<div>


* This study proposes a method using geographically weighted regression(GWR) and dasymetric mapping to estimate fine-scale population in buildings, addressing the challenges of COVID-19 transmission in urban areas.
* By utilizing building usage and floor area as auxiliary data, it provides detailed population distribution estimates for Seoul, which can inform effective pandemic response strategies.
